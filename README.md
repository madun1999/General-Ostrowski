# General-Ostrowski Automaton Generator
This software produces Algorithms 0,1,2, and 3 of addition automaton, and recognition automaton for any Ostrowski numeration system, which can then be used to produce the full addition automaton in Walnut.
This project is based on an undergraduate research project at the [Illinois Geometry Lab](https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl) and directed by [Philipp Hieronymi](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~phierony/) and [Erik Walsberg](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~erikw/).
